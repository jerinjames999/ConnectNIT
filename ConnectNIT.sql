A spokeswoman for the European Union talked of the need for de-escalation by “exclusively diplomatic routes.”</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\r\nThere was even praise for Mr. Trump’s decision to back out of an airstrike that others might have been too proud to cancel.\r\n\r\n“Trump’s rather unconventional decision-making style may have saved the day,” said Crispin Blunt, a senior Conservative lawmaker in Britain who is a former head of Parliament’s foreign affairs committee.\r\n\r\n“I suspect other presidents, having approved the mission, would not have aborted for fear of having to give a public explanation that plainly suggests inadequate consideration in the first place,” added Mr. Blunt, who — like the British government itself — opposes Mr. Trump’s policy on Iran. “The strength of the war lobby with a line to him should not be underestimated, and I’m relieved he faced them down, if dangerously late in the day.”\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nExplicit condemnation came mostly from analysts and lawmakers without formal positions in government.\r\n\r\n“What President Trump says or does is certainly what he thinks is good for the United States,” said Mireille Clapot, the vice president of the French Parliament’s foreign affairs committee. “I cannot certify it’s good for the entire world.”\r\n\r\nEditors’ Picks\r\n\r\nFor Taylor Swift, Is Ego Stronger Than Pride?\r\n\r\nHow a Dallas Photojournalist Captured an Image of a Gunman Mid-Attack\r\n\r\nHe’s Your Destiny.

Some want to eliminate private insurance, but many others said that was a step too far.\r\n“Medicare for all” is the hottest idea in the Democratic presidential race for overhauling the nation’s health care system, and it is a phrase quite likely to be heard repeatedly at the first debates this week. But despite all the buzz, it turns out that the concept is dividing the 2020 field.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nA new survey of the Democratic candidates by The New York Times finds that many of them prefer less sweeping changes than the Medicare for All Act, the single-payer bill introduced by Senator Bernie Sanders and supported by Senator Elizabeth Warren and several other presidential hopefuls. A majority of candidates in the survey — including former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., the leader in early polls — said they would rather add a “public option” in the health care system that would compete with private plans.\r\n\r\nThe public option was once considered too far-reaching — champions of the idea in Congress could not muster quite enough support to include it in the Affordable Care Act in 2010. But it is now seen as a more moderate alternative to Mr. Sanders’s plan, which would all but eliminate private health insurance and enroll everyone in a government-run program.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nEven some candidates who back the single-payer approach of Medicare for All told The Times they would also be willing to support a choice between some kind of public option and private insurance, an acknowledgment that many Americans like their private coverage and want the choice to keep it.\r\n\r\nSign Up for On Politics With Lisa Lerer\r\nA spotlight on the people reshaping our politics.

(26, 'opinion', 'The Long, Cruel History of the Anti-Abortion Crusade', 'Amid the anti-abortion measures being pushed through state legislatures, consider the mazy history of abortion in the United States. Women, capable of determining and managing their reproductive rights, have been undermined by men in power before.\r\n\r\nPrior to the 1840s, abortion was widespread and not illegal in our country. In the time of the Puritans, America’s deeply religious founding fathers, abortion was allowed until the fetus was “quick” — when the woman could feel the fetus move. Before modern diagnostic ultrasound, abortion was permissible beyond the first trimester — up to four or five months. Our founding fathers got this right; the choice to have an abortion or a child belonged to the woman.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nBeginning in the 1840s, and continuing over decades, abortion was outlawed state by state, becoming illegal everywhere in the United States by 1900 — until 1973, when the Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision held that a woman had a constitutional right to an abortion. For more than two centuries, after the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth Rock, abortion was largely permitted. Why was it prohibited for almost a century?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIn the 1830s, women having babies at lying-in hospitals ran a far greater risk of dying from puerperal sepsis than women having babies at home. With the help of midwives, women had been having babies and abortions at home — since colonial times. Had midwives been as busy performing abortions as delivering babies? Beginning in the 1840s, doctors sought to gain control of the reproduction business. Doctors were establishing their new profession; midwives and homeopaths were their competition. But why did doctors lobby for abortion to be illegal? What was their logic? Did doctors underestimate how great the need for abortion was? We know what the doctors wanted, and they achieved it; they became the arbiters of women’s reproductive health care. We don’t know the doctors’ reasons for making abortion illegal. In the 1840s, the fetus wasn’t yet sacred. Fetal life was still defined by “quickening” — when the woman felt the fetus move, not before the fourth or fifth month. From the 1840s to 1900, we know the results of what the doctors did — not their thoughts.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSign Up for Jamelle Bouie\'s Newsletter\r\nJoin Jamelle Bouie as he shines a light on overlooked writing, culture and ideas from around the internet.\r\n\r\nSIGN UP\r\nOne job of a society with a social conscience is to rescue its citizens who are trapped, who are painted into a corner. I see my job as a fiction writer with a social conscience as the opposite. As a storyteller, I look for worst-case scenarios; my job is to trap my characters. I began “The Cider House Rules,” my sixth novel, in the early 1980s. I purposely wrote a historical novel, beginning in the 1920s, when abortion was illegal, unsafe and (for the most part) unavailable. Maine was one of the first states to make abortion illegal; I put the orphanage I called St. Cloud’s in Maine. I purposely painted my protagonist, Homer Wells, into a corner. Homer is an orphan; his several adoptions don’t work out. Homer keeps coming back to the orphanage — St. Cloud’s is his only home. Dr. Larch, the orphanage physician (and abortionist), teaches Homer to be a doctor. In Dr. Larch’s opinion, Homer has near-perfect obstetrical and gynecological procedure. But Homer doesn’t want to perform abortions. He’s an orphan; his mother let him live. \r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nHomer has no argument with Dr. Larch’s decision to give women what they want, but Homer has a personal reason (and a good one) not to perform abortions. Here’s the corner Homer is painted into: How can Homer not feel obligated to help women, when women can’t get help from anyone else? If women have no choice, how can doctors have a choice? Homer will leave St. Cloud’s; he refuses to perform abortions. What he will encounter, in the world outside the orphanage, is a woman who can’t get help from anyone else. The death of Dr. Larch will bring Homer back to the orphanage — this time, to be the physician (and the abortionist) at St. Cloud’s. In a no-choice world, Homer is trapped.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nIt took 14 years to make the film of “The Cider House Rules.” I won an Oscar for best adapted screenplay. Over time, it’s more meaningful to me that the movie also won a Maggie Award — named after Planned Parenthood’s founder, Margaret Sanger, in recognition of “exceptional achievement in support of reproductive rights.”\r\n\r\nI respect your personal reasons not to have an abortion — no one is forcing you to have one. I respect your choice. I’m pro-choice — often called pro-abortion by the anti-abortion crusaders, although no one is pro-abortion. What’s unequal about the argument is the choice; the difference between pro-life and pro-choice is the choice. Pro-life proponents have no qualms about forcing women to go through childbirth — they give women no choice.\r\n</p><p>\r\nBefore the Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision in 1973, the opposition to abortion wasn’t widely referred to as right to life. Pope Pius XII used the “right to life” term in a 1951 papal encyclical — an “Address to Midwives on the Nature of Their Profession.” “Every human being, even the child in the womb, has the right to life directly from God and not from his parents, not from any society or human authority,” the pope told the midwives. Poor midwives — first doctors stop them from helping women, then the pope. I must remind the Roman Catholic Church of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution: “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.” In other words, we are free to practice the religion of our choice, and we are protected from having someone else’s religion practiced on us. Freedom of religion in the United States also means freedom from religion.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe “pro-life” term was adopted by anti-abortion crusaders after the Roe v. Wade decision. The anti-abortion cause didn’t promote itself as “pro-life” until the more punitive-sounding “anti-abortion” label failed. In 1976, with the passing of the Hyde Amendment, prohibiting the use of federal funds for most abortions, opposition to abortion gained support among Republicans. The Christian right was on the rise; their socially conservative policies are inseparable from today’s Republican Party. In 1980, aided by the Baptist minister Jerry Falwell’s Moral Majority, the pro-life zealots took control of the Republican Party’s platform committee. Four anti-abortion presidents followed — Ronald Reagan, George H. W. and George W. Bush, and Donald Trump. Isn’t it as clear now as it was in the Reagan years? Aren’t the same people who sacralize the fetus generally opposed to any meaningful welfare for unwanted children and unmarried mothers?\r\n\r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nHow a Dallas Photojournalist Captured an Image of a Gunman Mid-Attack\r\n\r\nFor Taylor Swift, Is Ego Stronger Than Pride?\r\n\r\nGiant Squid, Phantom of the Deep, Reappears on Video\r\nThe prevailing impetus to oppose abortion is to punish the woman who doesn’t want the child. The sacralizing of the fetus is a ploy. How can “life” be sacred (and begin at six weeks, or at conception), if a child’s life isn’t sacred after it’s born? Clearly, a woman’s life is never sacred; as clearly, a woman has no reproductive rights. The Roman Catholic Church, and many evangelical and fundamentalist churches, willfully subject women to mandatory childbirth and motherhood — procreation is deemed a woman’s primary purpose and function. I’m not overstating. In his 1951 “Address to Midwives,” Pope Pius XII states that “the procreation and upbringing of a new life” is the primary end of marriage.\r\n</p><p>\r\nWhen “The Cider House Rules” was published, some of my younger friends and fellow feminists thought it was quaint that I’d written a historical novel about abortion. They meant: now that abortion rights were secure, now that Roe v. Wade was the law of the land. At the time, I tried to say this nicely: “If you think Roe v. Wade is safe, you’re one of the reasons it isn’t.” Not surprisingly, my older women friends — women who were old enough to have had sex before 1973 — knew better than to imagine that Roe v. Wade would ever be safe. Men and women have to keep making the case for women’s reproductive rights; women have been making the case for years, but more men need to speak up.\r\n</p><p>\r\nOf an unmarried woman or girl who got pregnant, people of my grandparents’ generation used to say: “She is paying the piper.” Meaning, she deserves what she gets — namely, to give birth to a child. That cruelty is the abiding impetus behind the dishonestly named right-to-life movement. Pro-life always was (and remains) a marketing term. Whatever the anti-abortion crusaders call themselves, they don’t care what happens to an unwanted child — not after the child is born — and they’ve never cared about the mother.', 'John Irving', 6, 0, '2019-06-24 07:22:48', '2019-06-24-072248the-long-cruel-history-of-the-anti-abortion-crusade', 0, 'assets/images/articles/opinion/aa9d89dfb1ae4c93b2b70517a33e5376-jumbo.jpg', 'image description by demo', 1, '2019-08-22 17:50:57'),

Blackberry Mountain lets guests decide what wellness means to them. “Some people might want to do three classes every morning and hike to lunch,” Ms. Beall said. “Some people might do one. I can’t wait until I have time to exercise all day long for three days, to not drink and feel so clean and amazing, but I also love the more balanced, realistic idea of, ‘Let’s get some exercise done in the morning, I’m going to eat a great lunch, I might have a glass of wine in the afternoon, and then I might do a cocktail clinic.’ It’s a mix. People can take it for what they want.”\r\n</p><p>\r\nWhile Blackberry Farm includes breakfast, lunch and dinner in its daily room rate, the Mountain’s includes breakfast, dinner and most classes (alcohol, at both resorts, is charged by consumption). This, according to Hall Mebane, one of the 21 fitness and outdoor adventure guides employed by the Mountain (he specializes in rock climbing) is what sets the two resorts apart.\r\n\r\n“When we say ‘wellness,’ we mean mental and physical wellness,” he said. “Everything on the Mountain is meant to get you into a state of well-mindedness. Food at our restaurants is healthier, it’s meant to be fuel for you to re-engage in activity,” which need not mean breaking a sweat (although the state of the art fitness center and curious class offerings like cardio drumming and suspension Pilates make a good case for doing so). One of Ms. Beall’s priorities, in developing the Mountain, was to build an artist’s studio — her mother is an artist and never minded paint on anyone’s clothes. The Mountain offers classes in disciplines like painting, basket making and hand-thrown pottery.\r\n</p><p>\r\n“That’s part of wellness: taking time away from our devices to use the other side of our brain to engage in creating something,” said Ms. Beall. (The popularity of the pottery class may have had unintended side effects. During the April house party, a guest passed around a phone showing an Instagram post of the glossy, artfully imperfect bowls a friend made during a recent stay: “Look how cool they turned out, and they’ll pack and ship them home for you, too!”)\r\n\r\nA bartender mixes drinks at the Whippoorwill Lounge of Blackberry Mountain.\r\nCredit\r\nRobert Rausch for The New York Times\r\n\r\n\r\nImage\r\nA bartender mixes drinks at the Whippoorwill Lounge of Blackberry Mountain.\r\nA bartender mixes drinks at the Whippoorwill Lounge of Blackberry Mountain.CreditRobert Rausch for The New York Times\r\n</p><p>\r\nA decade ago, Ms. Beall, 42, and her husband, Sam Beall, purchased 5,200 acres of woods that they could see from the veranda of the Farm’s main house, wary of someone else scooping up the land and developing it to oblivion. They put 2,800 acres in conservation and had a few renderings made. “Sam had seen every inch of the mountain and knew it so well,” Ms. Beall said. “He’d take a four-wheeler up there and just go. I had been there a lot but I am not the adventurer he was.”\r\n\r\nRead more on wellness getaways:\r\nThe End of RelaxationNov. 7, 2016\r\n\r\nThe Oasis at the End of the Dusty RoadMay 16, 2019\r\n</p><p>\r\nIn 2001, Mr. Beall, a Culinary Institute of America-trained chef, took over management of Blackberry Farm from his parents, Kreis and Samuel E. Beall III (the elder Mr. Beall is the founder of the Ruby Tuesday chain of restaurants). Having attracted world-renowned chefs and the foodies who follow them to the Farm, with the Mountain, he and Ms. Beall sought to create a similar kind of haven for wilderness lovers. She never imagined doing it without him, but after Mr. Beall died in 2016, at age 39, following a skiing accident, Ms. Beall, a mother of five, felt compelled to see her husband’s vision through.\r\n</p><p>\r\n“I joke, but not really, that if I hadn’t had to get up and get dressed and go to a meeting about Blackberry Mountain, I don’t know what would have happened to me,” she said. “Figuring out the layout, the restaurants, the activities — it was a way for our whole team to honor Sam but also to say, ‘This is such a crazy idea, Sam would’ve loved it.’”\r\n\r\n\r\nThat’s how the 1.4 mile hike to breakfast came to be. Intrepid guests staying in the six Watchman cabins by the Firetower can kick off their stay with this uphill climb, though they’d do best to let an SUV transport their luggage. Most of the property’s 22 other cottages and multi-bedroom homes are within striking distance of the Lodge, and can be reached in a few minutes by foot or golf cart, which are swifter and quieter than standard models (they don’t beep when backing up, so as not to disrupt any quests for mental wellness).\r\n</p><p>\r\nOther parts of the property reflect Ms. Beall’s eye for design and knack for anticipating what guests want. While the Farm’s style of décor is Southern Plantation home meets French country estate, with worn wood, heavy drapes, and leather bound classics lining the shelves, the Mountain’s is decidedly more modern. Grays and blues instead of maroons and golds. “The Marine Corps Way to Win on Wall Street” instead of “The Essays of Ralph Waldo Emerson.” Organic Himalayan pink sea salt popcorn in the complimentary mini bar instead of potato chips and pimento dip. A room at the Farm might include one of Mr. Beall’s hardcover cookbooks; at the Mountain, every room comes with a pocket-size guide to flora, fauna, and “how to enjoy the mountain.” (“Step 1: set your intention.”)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSome design touches from the Farm translated to the Mountain, like the heated floors in the bathroom and the framed painting that hides the television — it’s on a pulley weighed down by a hunk of Tennessee field stone, a trick Ms. Beall learned from her mother-in-law. “Sometimes, during the planning of this place, I’d be the only woman in a room full of men, with all of them going, ‘But where’s the TV going to go?’” she said, rolling her eyes.\r\n</p><p>\r\nIn Ms. Beall’s ideal world, the painting wouldn’t move. The idea is for guests to spend less time watching television in their rooms and more time out on the mountain, mingling with their fellow campers, building connections that will last after they leave. Two of mine have: Ms. Favia-Erickson, an Indian food fanatic, happened to be in Los Angeles, where I live, in late April and joined my husband and I for a home-cooked Indian meal (made, I confess, by my mother-in-law).\r\n</p><p>\r\nAnd while exactly none of Mr. Zimmern’s clay pigeon shooting skills rubbed off on me, we bonded over something else: the sauce that he put on top of his Patagonia-caught salmon at dinner on Saturday night, a piquant, mouth-numbing flurry of flavors so memorable, I had to ask him what it was. A week later, I had a bottle of his Minneapolis restaurant’s Sichuan peppercorn-flecked Mala sauce on my doorstep. (It’s being carefully rationed.)\r\n\r\n“When you connect people with a common interest, it’s magical,” Ms. Beall said. “That’s our goal with the Mountain: how can we create more magic for our guests?” Hiking not necessarily required.\r\n\r\n', 'Sheila Marikar', 3, 0, '2019-06-24 07:35:47', '2019-06-24-073547in-tennessee-blackberry-farm-takes-over-a-mountain', 0, 'assets/images/articles/editorials/19BLACKBERRY-slide-0S2U-superJumbo.jpg', 'image description by demo', 1, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

If that didn’t become clear when the Los Angeles Lakers reached an agreement to acquire Anthony Davis from the New Orleans Pelicans less than 48 hours after the Toronto Raptors dethroned the Golden State Warriors as league champions, it must be obvious after a thoroughly bonkers draft.\r\n</p><p>\r\nNone of this, mind you, should be a surprise to anyone studying the way several franchises have been behaving in the Warriors’ considerable shadow.\r\n\r\nMarc Stein\'s Newsletter\r\nMarc Stein has covered Jordan. He\'s covered Kobe. And LeBron vs. the Warriors. Go behind the N.B.A.\'s curtain with basketball\'s foremost expert.\r\n\r\nSIGN UP\r\nThroughout the last two years of Golden State’s five-year run of title contention, teams from the next tier made numerous moves to try to close the gap rather than wait the Warriors out. You’ll recall that in the summer of 2017, Houston and Oklahoma City quickly responded to the Warriors’ first title with Kevin Durant with ambitious trades: the Rockets by adding Chris Paul and the Thunder by gambling on Paul George. Boston also brought in Kyrie Irving.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThen this past season, after Toronto made its big summertime dice roll for Kawhi Leonard, three of the East’s top four contenders — Milwaukee, Philadelphia and those same Raptors — commenced a slew of major in-season acquisitions to try to capitalize on LeBron James’s defection to the Los Angeles Lakers in the West.\r\n\r\nThe Lakers and Pelicans didn’t even wait a full two days after the end of the finals to shake up the N.B.A. with a trade agreement sending Anthony Davis to Los Angeles.\r\nCredit\r\nChris Graythen/Getty Images\r\n\r\n\r\nImageThe Lakers and Pelicans didn&rsquo;t even wait a full two days after the end of the finals to shake up the N.B.A. with a trade agreement sending Anthony Davis to Los Angeles.\r\nThe Lakers and Pelicans didn’t even wait a full two days after the end of the finals to shake up the N.B.A. with a trade agreement sending Anthony Davis to Los Angeles.CreditChris Graythen/Getty Images\r\n</p><p>\r\nSo you can imagine how emboldened some executives feel to swing big now, with the Warriors in tatters after the devastating injuries to Durant and Klay Thompson in the N.B.A. finals. That was evident the day before the draft when the Utah Jazz did what they were hesitant to do in February by meeting the Memphis Grizzlies’ asking price in a trade for Mike Conley.\r\n\r\nThe path to title contention, in truth, will not be nearly as wide open as it seems if Leonard, the free-agent-to-be, stays with the Raptors on a two-year contract approaching $70 million with a player option in Year 2. Should Kawhi go that route, and if the veteran center Marc Gasol delays his free agency one more year, Toronto’s core would essentially stay intact for another season and give us a clear favorite for the 2019-20 campaign.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe Raptors, though, have feared that the Los Angeles Clippers would sign Leonard away at the first opportunity from the minute they got him in July 2018. We’re roughly two weeks from finally finding out how rational those fears are, but Canada’s collective confidence appeared fragile Thursday when photos of Leonard apparently buying cardboard moving boxes at a Home Depot emerged. Many Raptors fans inevitably interpreted the pictures as an omen of doomsday — even though Leonard showed up at a Toronto Blue Jays game hours later.\r\n\r\nTo borrow a word Stephen Curry used during the recent N.B.A. finals to describe the abnormal: It’s that sort of janky time in this league.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe new champions could lose Leonard, a two-time finals most valuable player, and plummet back to the ranks of flawed challengers as quickly as they rose to the summit. The Warriors don’t know if they can keep Durant away from the Knicks or the Nets in free agency, but they do know they’ll have to cope without Durant and Thompson, another soon-to-be free agent, for the bulk of next season while they heal, even if they re-sign both.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe outlook is no brighter for the Rockets and the Celtics, who are soaked in their own dramas so soon after they were widely classified as elite when last season began. Houston’s contract talks with Coach Mike D’Antoni have broken down yet again, while Rockets management strains to debunk near-daily reports that the team’s two headstrong stars, James Harden and Chris Paul, can no longer coexist. Boston’s predicament, furthermore, may be even worse, with Irving and Al Horford regarded as virtual locks to bolt in free agency and Davis — the team’s longtime dream target — no longer an option.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe leaguewide upheaval and uncertainty are such that the ever-conservative Jazz saw fit to surrender two first-round picks to get Conley and make a run in the perennially deep (and brutal) West. Unpredictability is so rampant that the upstart Nets are convinced that they are not only firmly in the lead to sign Irving, but also a legitimate threat to persuade Durant to ignore the Madison Square Garden lure of the Knicks and join his good friend Kyrie in Brooklyn.', 'Marc Stein', 4, 0, '2019-06-24 07:39:47', '2019-06-24-073947the-nbas-hot-stove-has-burned-down-the-league', 0, 'assets/images/articles/editorials/merlin_156503379_165aa719-38f6-4a7c-8e7f-9798ed79a0b6-superJumbo.jpg', 'image description by demo', 1, '0000-00-00 00:00:00');

(30, 'main_news', 'What Happens After Amazon’s Domination Is Complete? Its Bookstore Offers Clues', 'SPERRYVILLE, Va. — “The Sanford Guide to Antimicrobial Therapy” is a medical handbook that recommends the right amount of the right drug for treating ailments from bacterial pneumonia to infected wounds. Lives depend on it.\r\n</p><p>\r\nIt is not the sort of book a doctor should puzzle over, wondering, “Is that a ‘1’ or a ‘7’ in the recommended dosage?” But that is exactly the possibility that has haunted the guide’s publisher, Antimicrobial Therapy, for the past two years as it confronted a flood of counterfeits — many of which were poorly printed and hard to read — in Amazon’s vast bookstore.\r\n</p><p>\r\n“This threatens a bunch of patients — and our whole business,” said Scott Kelly, the publisher’s vice president.\r\n\r\nMr. Kelly’s problems arise directly from Amazon’s domination of the book business. The company sells substantially more than half of the books in the United States, including new and used physical volumes as well as digital and audio formats. Amazon is also a platform for third-party sellers, a publisher, a printer, a self-publisher, a review hub, a textbook supplier and a distributor that now runs its own chain of brick-and-mortar stores.\r\n</p><p>\r\nInterested in All Things Tech?\r\nThe Bits newsletter will keep you updated on the latest from Silicon Valley and the technology industry.\r\n\r\nSIGN UP\r\nBut Amazon takes a hands-off approach to what goes on in its bookstore, never checking the authenticity, much less the quality, of what it sells. It does not oversee the sellers who have flocked to its site in any organized way.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThat has resulted in a kind of lawlessness. Publishers, writers and groups such as the Authors Guild said counterfeiting of books on Amazon had surged. The company has been reactive rather than proactive in dealing with the issue, they said, often taking action only when a buyer complains. Many times, they added, there is nowhere to appeal and their only recourse is to integrate even more closely with Amazon.\r\n\r\nThe scope of counterfeiting across Amazon goes far beyond books. E-commerce has taken counterfeit goods from flea markets to the mainstream, and Amazon is by far the e-commerce heavyweight. But books offer a way to see the depths of the issue.\r\n</p><p>\r\n“Being a tech monopoly means you don’t have to care about quality,” said Bill Pollock, a San Francisco publisher who has dealt with fake versions of his firm’s computer books on Amazon.\r\n\r\nAn Amazon spokeswoman denied that counterfeiting of books was a problem, saying, “This report cites a handful of complaints, but even a handful is too many and we will keep working until it’s zero.” The company said it strictly prohibited counterfeit products and last year denied accounts to more than one million suspected “bad actors.”\r\n</p><p>\r\nHow a Dallas Photojournalist Captured an Image of a Gunman Mid-Attack\r\n\r\nGiant Squid, Phantom of the Deep, Reappears on Video\r\n“There is strong competition amongst booksellers, from major retailers to independent booksellers,” the spokeswoman added.\r\n\r\nWhat happens after a tech giant dominates an industry is increasingly a question as lawmakers and regulators begin taking a harder look at technology companies, asking when dominance shades into a monopoly. This month, lawmakers in the House said they were scrutinizing the tech giants’ possible anticompetitive behavior. And the Federal Trade Commission is specifically examining Amazon.\r\n</p><p>\r\nIn Amazon’s bookstore, the unruly behavior has been widespread, aided by print-on-demand technology. Booksellers that seem to have no verifiable existence outside Amazon offer $10 books for $100 or even $1,000 on the site, raising suspicions of algorithms run wild or even money-laundering. The problem of fake reviews is so bad that the F.T.C. has already gotten involved.\r\n\r\nThose who write a popular book open themselves up to being “summarized” on Amazon. At least eight books purport to summarize “Bad Blood,” John Carreyrou’s best-selling account of fraud in Silicon Valley. The popular novel “Where the Crawdads Sing” has at least seven summaries. “Discover a beautiful coming-of-age story without all of the unnecessary information included in the actual novel!” says one that has 19 five-star reviews, all of which read as if they were fake.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAnd then there are the counterfeits.\r\n\r\nA counterfeit version of Danielle Trussoni’s acclaimed memoir, “Falling Through the Earth,” on Amazon misspelled the author’s name on the cover.\r\n“It’s unacceptable and I’m furious,” the author Andrew Sean Greer tweeted after people complained last summer that fakes of his Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, “Less,” were being sold as the real thing. There was a counterfeit edition of Danielle Trussoni’s acclaimed memoir, “Falling Through the Earth,” on the site that misspelled her name on the cover. Lauren Groff tweeted that there was “an illegal paperback” of “Florida,” her National Book Award nominee, on Amazon.\r\n</p><p>\r\nDead writers get hit, too. Arthur Miller’s “The Crucible” was pirated. So was a volume of classic stories by Jorge Luis Borges. For 18 months Amazon has sold a counterfeit of Agatha Christie’s “Murder on the Orient Express” despite warnings in reader reviews that it is a “monstrosity,” dispensing with such standard features as proofreading and paragraph indenting.\r\n</p><p>\r\nTechnical books, which tend to be more expensive than fiction, are frequent victims. No Starch Press has tried to squelch fake editions of its computer manuals for three years. Mr. Pollock, No Starch’s founder, said Amazon had the same laid-back approach to bad actors on its platform as Facebook and YouTube.\r\n\r\n“Amazon is the Wild Wild West,” he said.\r\n\r\nAmazon has sold a counterfeit version of Agatha Christie’s “Murder on the Orient Express” despite reader reviews warning that it is “maybe even a fake?”\r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nImage\r\nAmazon has sold a counterfeit version of Agatha Christie’s “Murder on the Orient Express” despite reader reviews warning that it is “maybe even a fake?”\r\nAmazon has sold a counterfeit version of Agatha Christie’s “Murder on the Orient Express” despite reader reviews warning that it is “maybe even a fake?”\r\nThis is not really negligence on Amazon’s part. It is the company’s business model. Amazon, which does not break out revenue or profit from bookselling or publishing, assumes that everyone on its platform operates in good faith until proven otherwise. “It is your responsibility to ensure that your content doesn’t violate laws or copyright, trademark, privacy, publicity or other rights,” it tells prospective publishers and sellers.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAt Antimicrobial Therapy, the first warning that something was amiss with the Sanford Guide came with reviews on Amazon. “Several pages smudged and unable to read,” one buyer said in 2017, posting photos as proof. “Seems as the book was photocopied,” said a second. “Characters are smeared,” wrote a third.\r\n\r\nThe company, whose books were sold to Amazon by distributors, did test buys. It got some copies from Amazon and others from its third-party sellers, including UsedText4u, Robinhood Book Foundation and 24x7 Book. Of the 34 books that Mr. Kelly bought, at least 30 were counterfeit. None of the booksellers responded to requests for comment.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe first warning that there might be problems with copies of the Sanford Guide available on Amazon came in the form of customer reviews.\r\n\r\n\r\nImage\r\nThe first warning that there might be problems with copies of the Sanford Guide available on Amazon came in the form of customer reviews.\r\nThe first warning that there might be problems with copies of the Sanford Guide available on Amazon came in the form of customer reviews.\r\nMr. Kelly spent hours writing responses to customers who complained about their copies but didn’t realize they had counterfeits. He tried tracking down the source of the fakes and attempted to communicate with Amazon. Eventually he wrote to the retailer’s founder, Jeff Bezos, saying, “Amazon is knowingly and willfully fulfilling most orders for our title with counterfeits that may contain errors leading to injury or death of their patients.”\r\n\r\nMr. Kelly got a response two weeks later from “Raj,” a member of “the Amazon Seller Performance team.” Raj said that an unnamed third-party seller had been barred from selling the book but that the seller might now appeal directly to AMT, and that if the company wanted to retract the whole thing, here was what to do.\r\n</p><p>\r\n“They were very reluctant to actually engage with us about the problem,” Mr. Kelly said of Amazon.\r\n\r\nThe Authors Guild said it was also seeing “a massive rise” in counterfeit books. “Authors tell us, ‘I know I had more sales, but I don’t see them in my royalties.’” said Mary Rasenberger, the guild’s executive director. “Amazon owns the reseller platform, and we think that’s where these books are being sold.”\r\n\r\nIn February, Amazon included counterfeiting in its financial disclosures as a risk factor for the first time, saying it might not be able to prevent its merchants “from selling unlawful, counterfeit, pirated or stolen goods” or “selling goods in an unlawful or unethical manner.”\r\n\r\nYet the company has such a grip on books that counterfeits do not seem to harm it. They might even increase its business.\r\n</p><p>\r\n“A book takes a year or more to write,” said Andrew Hunt of the Pragmatic Bookshelf, a North Carolina publisher of computer books that had at least one of its titles stolen. “But to steal the book and upload it to Amazon takes only a minute. As the expression goes, there’s a low cost of entry.”\r\n\r\nAn original 2018 copy of “The Sanford Guide to Antimicrobial Therapy,” left, and a counterfeit that was available on Amazon.\r\nCredit\r\nIsabelle Baldwin for The New York Times\r\n\r\n\r\nImage\r\nAn original 2018 copy of “The Sanford Guide to Antimicrobial Therapy,” left, and a counterfeit that was available on Amazon.\r\nAn original 2018 copy of “The Sanford Guide to Antimicrobial Therapy,” left, and a counterfeit that was available on Amazon.CreditIsabelle Baldwin for The New York Times\r\nAnd when someone buys a counterfeit, Mr. Hunt added, the real author may get cheated but Amazon still makes a sale. “You could ask, What’s their incentive to do something?” he said.\r\n</p><p>\r\nA dream turns into something else\r\nAmazon fulfilled Jamie Lendino’s dream of becoming an author.\r\n\r\nA computer buff who delights in the digital past, Mr. Lendino, 45, wrote a book called “Breakout,” about the Atari machines of the 1980s that ushered in a new era of gaming. He self-published it two years ago through Amazon, which charged him nothing upfront but took a commission on the 1,223 paperback copies bought by devoted Atari fans.\r\n\r\nThen Amazon fulfilled someone’s dream of becoming Jamie Lendino.\r\n\r\nA fellow purportedly named Steve S. Thomas took Mr. Lendino’s book a year ago and remade it as his own. Mr. Thomas got rid of the title “Breakout” and converted the subtitle — “How Atari 8-Bit Computers Defined a Generation” — into the title.

(31, 'main_news', 'Maine Needed New, Young Residents. African Migrants Began Arriving by the Dozens.', 'PORTLAND, Me. — Through the winter, the families streamed into Portland, bringing stories of violence and persecution in their home countries in central Africa. Portland’s shelter for homeless families soon filled to capacity, so the city put mats on the floor of a Salvation Army gym for 80 more people.\r\n\r\nThen that, too, wasn’t enough. This month, 250 migrants from Africa arrived in this northeastern city of roughly 67,000 residents in the span of just a week, overflowing the overflow space and forcing Portland to hastily convert a basketball arena into an emergency shelter. Urgent calls went out for interpreters who could speak French, Portuguese and Lingala, a language spoken in the Democratic Republic of Congo. City Council meetings were given over to grappling with how Portland would pay for all of this — and the possibility that still more migrants might be coming.\r\n\r\nIt is a bit of a mystery in Maine, one of the oldest and whitest states in the country, how Portland has become a focal point for a sudden surge of migrants, mostly from Angola and Congo, who are seeking asylum.\r\n\r\nMaine has long wrestled with an aging work force, and some leaders view immigrants as a welcome answer to the state’s struggles to lure younger people to live and work here. Still, the sheer numbers — and the suddenness of the latest arrivals — have opened up a debate about how much Portland should be doing to help immigrants and whether it should entice more of them to come.\r\n\r\nSign Up for The Daily Newsletter\r\nEvery Friday, get an exclusive look at how one of the week’s biggest news stories on “The Daily” podcast came together.\r\n\r\nSIGN UP\r\n“I love the fact that these folks are coming here, and they want a better life, and they’ve chosen Portland,” Jon Jennings, the city manager, said. “But at the same time, I’ve got to figure out how to pay to pave streets and fix sidewalks and all of the things that are uniquely responsible to a municipal government.”\r\n\r\nThere is friction over the issue, even inside City Hall.\r\n\r\n“If we have discovered the magic wand that will bring young families to Portland to help us build the next generation, why would we want to stop that, especially when it costs us so little money?” Ethan Strimling, Portland’s mayor, said.\r\n\r\nThe migrants arriving in this city have undergone a grueling journey, traveling by air or sea to South America, and then north on foot and by bus to the southern border of the United States, where most of them were arrested by border officials and released with notices to appear in immigration court after they declared their intention to seek asylum.\r\n\r\nNearly 800 migrants from Africa have been apprehended on one stretch of the Texas border and released by authorities since the beginning of October; the surge surprised and puzzled immigration officials, who are more accustomed to seeing Central American families crossing the border. Hundreds of African migrants arrived just this month and were taken to San Antonio, where Catholic Charities provided bus tickets to Portland and other cities that the migrants named as their destinations.\r\n\r\nEditors’ Picks\r\n\r\nHow a Dallas Photojournalist Captured an Image of a Gunman Mid-Attack\r\n\r\nGiant Squid, Phantom of the Deep, Reappears on Video\r\nAmong Portland’s residents and even some of the families arriving from Africa, it is uncertain how this place became such a draw.\r\n\r\nMore than 200 asylum seekers are now staying at the Expo, a municipally owned basketball arena in Portland.\r\nCredit\r\nTristan Spinski for The New York Times\r\n\r\n\r\nImageMore than 200 asylum seekers are now staying at the Expo, a municipally owned basketball arena in Portland.\r\nMore than 200 asylum seekers are now staying at the Expo, a municipally owned basketball arena in Portland.CreditTristan Spinski for The New York Times\r\nMr. Strimling, the mayor, has been an outspoken advocate for welcoming immigrants. In April, when President Trump wrote on Twitter that his administration was considering sending detained immigrants to so-called sanctuary cities, Mr. Strimling responded: “If he wants to send more immigrants our way, bring them on.”\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Jennings, who runs the day-to-day operations of Portland, expressed concern about the costs of aiding everyone, and criticized the mayor for having essentially invited asylum seekers to come here.\r\n\r\nImmigrants who are seeking asylum are not permitted to work until at least six months after they file their asylum applications, so Portland has scrambled to provide support. Helped by $400,000 in donations, the city has given emergency assistance to roughly 300 people in recent weeks.\r\n\r\n“If you started to see double that or more, I’m not sure how we would be able to handle that,” Mr. Jennings said. “That’s why I think we’ve got to be careful with the messaging and everything that we say publicly.”\r\n\r\nInside the Expo, the basketball arena now filled with 200 cots, families gave varying reasons for choosing Portland, a city that is 81 percent white but that already has a sizable community of immigrants from Africa, including from Congo and Angola. About 13 percent of the city’s population is foreign born, according to census data, many of those residents from Somalia.\r\n\r\nGloire Kikweta, 24, who came from Congo with his wife and two children — the younger of whom was born in Brazil on their way here — said he had left his home because he was being pursued by law enforcement for participating in protests against the former president, Joseph Kabila. He said he did not have a plan of where to go in the United States, but when he was in San Antonio, African immigrants there advised him to go to Portland, telling him that it was an aging city that needed more people, and that it was safe.\r\n\r\nVincent Mbala, 32, who is also from Congo, and came with his wife and three children, said that he learned through internet research that Maine provided financial support for asylum seekers. Maine is unusual in providing general assistance, for up to two years, to immigrants who have valid visas or who have applied for asylum. In most states, asylum seekers rely on local nonprofit groups for aid until they can work, and in many cases struggle to afford housing and food.\r\n\r\nPortland also has what local officials believe is the only municipal fund in the country that provides support to asylum seekers before they submit their applications. Called the Community Support Fund, the program was created in 2015 when the Republican former governor, Paul R. LePage, was trying to cut off asylum seekers from the state’s general assistance program. Maine’s new governor, Janet Mills, a Democrat, visited Portland’s shelter in recent weeks and has pledged to help the city financially.\r\n\r\nAround Portland, many residents have greeted the migrants enthusiastically. More than 1,200 people have volunteered to help at the Expo. Leaders in the city’s African immigrant community have mobilized people to serve as interpreters and to cook meals for the migrants.\r\n\r\nComplaints, too, have come. Some Portland residents said that the city needed to focus more on local needs. The views reflected strains caused by Portland’s recent success in attracting another group — young professionals from other states — whose presence has driven up rents even as it has fueled the local economy.\r\n\r\nThis year, Mr. Jennings, the city manager, proposed that Portland phase out the municipal fund for asylum seekers. In a recent interview, he said he believed it was one reason migrants were coming here.\r\n\r\nSome of the migrants have friends or relatives in Portland. Others said they had heard that the city was welcoming to immigrants.\r\nCredit\r\nTristan Spinski for The New York Times\r\n\r\n\r\nImage\r\nSome of the migrants have friends or relatives in Portland.

Others said they had heard that the city was welcoming to immigrants.CreditTristan Spinski for The New York Times\r\nThe $200,000 fund was already overspent this year by April. The City Council is currently debating whether the fund should be available to anyone who arrives, no matter when, or if it should be limited, given the sudden surge of people.\r\n\r\nThe city has estimated that it would cost roughly $1.4 million to provide housing vouchers and other support to all the families currently staying at the Expo for a year.\r\n\r\nMr. Strimling, who recently announced he is seeking re-election as mayor, said he wanted to keep the fund open to anyone who needed it. He said that he doubted many migrants were coming to Portland because they had heard about the fund, but that, if they were, it was all the more reason to keep it going.\r\n\r\nIn East Bayside, a Portland neighborhood where some immigrants have settled in recent years, Roderic Morgan, 74, said the city had enough to deal with in taking care of the homeless population without extending help to asylum seekers. He also expressed concern that there were not enough jobs to go around.\r\n\r\nIn fact, many businesses in Maine say they struggle to find workers to fill jobs. The unemployment rate in Maine is 3.3 percent, and in the Portland metropolitan region, 2.6 percent. Both are lower than the national rate of 3.6 percent.\r\n\r\nAsked how he thought immigrants had changed Portland, Mr. Morgan, a retired newspaper deliveryman, raised a different issue.\r\n\r\n“It’s not just the immigrants that have invaded Portland,” he said. Well-off people from other places were moving to Portland and making the city unaffordable, he said.\r\n\r\nIn Parkside, not far from the Expo, Timothy Goldkin, 29, called it a “beautiful thing” to have more diversity in Maine. Mr. Goldkin, who has a housemate who is an asylum seeker, said he would rather have more immigrants in Portland than wealthy people migrating from other states and changing the city’s landscape and culture.\r\n\r\n“I’m much more worried about the people with lots of money who want to just completely make it their town, with zero regard to what it was,” he said, “than the folks who are fleeing persecution and in fear of their life and who are coming here to try to understand our culture and integrate into it, while still holding onto and bringing some of their own loveliness.”\r\n\r\nFor now, a major challenge for the city is to find permanent housing for the scores of families staying at the Expo and another shelter. Neighboring cities have agreed to help identify vacancies, and Mr. Jennings said that a lumber company in Jackman, three hours north of Portland, had reached out with an offer to house some of the families in Jackman if they were interested in working for the company.\r\n\r\n“I’ve had people all over the state inquire about whether some of these folks could come to other parts of the state, because they need qualified workers,” Mr. Jennings said. “They need new people.”', 'Kate Taylor', 18, 0, '2019-06-24 07:58:12', '2019-06-24-075812maine-needed-new-young-residents-african-migrants-began-arriving-by-the-dozens', 0, 'assets/images/articles/main_news/merlin_156742482_dbf7a31c-e2b3-40a3-9205-f2f16623b437-superJumbo.jpg', 'image description by demo', 1, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

Nearly $100,000 came from California alone.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe race for Queens district attorney, a contest about criminal justice reform, has become a clash between competing visions of how to fund candidates in local elections: sizable checks from local business interests versus small online donations from out of state.\r\n\r\nA Race for Queens D.A., but Ocasio-Cortez, Warren and Sanders LoomJune 20, 2019\r\n\r\nOne of Ms. Cabán’s leading opponents, Melinda Katz, the Queens borough president, has run a mostly traditional fund-raising effort in her candidacy. She has collected endorsements and cash from major labor unions and local politicians, while amassing a war chest of big donations for over a year from real estate figures and businesses.\r\n\r\nThat strategy was captured earlier this month at a steakhouse fund-raiser with labor leaders, landlords and lobbyists in Lower Manhattan. Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo was billed as a special guest.\r\n</p><p>\r\nEach side has portrayed the other’s donors as out of touch with average Queens voters in the primary battle, with the winner expected to be a heavy favorite in November’s general election against the Republican candidate, Daniel Kolgan, a lawyer.\r\n\r\n“You could make your entire political career out of donors who can’t vote for you, but they’re typically going to be big donors,” said David Fontana, a professor of law at George Washington University, who has written on limitations to out-of-district donations. “Now it’s becoming true for smaller donors.”\r\n\r\nCampaign cash flowing in from other states to influence local elections is nothing new: Wealthy donors in big cities have long supported both Republican and Democratic candidates. Activist billionaires like the Koch brothers and George Soros support local campaigns and issues they care about.\r\n</p><p>\r\nBut now those with just a few dollars to spare are getting in on the act. Campaigns have taken notice in recent years, soliciting donations using massive email lists and appeals to a common purpose to fuel small-dollar fund-raising efforts on behalf of candidates in far away places — especially Democratic ones.\r\n\r\n“It’s like discovering fire,” said Michael Casca, a Democratic strategist and veteran of Senator Bernie Sanders’s 2016 run. “The act of kicking in just a few bucks to candidates up and down the ballot in races across the country is creating an unseen level of solidarity in the movement.”\r\n\r\nThe approach was seen in Stacey Abrams’s run for governor in Georgia and Beto O’Rourke’s challenge to Senator Ted Cruz in Texas, both of whom received huge numbers of small-dollar contributions from around the country during their failed bids.\r\n</p><p>\r\nEditors’ Picks\r\n\r\nHow a Dallas Photojournalist Captured an Image of a Gunman Mid-Attack\r\n\r\nGiant Squid, Phantom of the Deep, Reappears on Video\r\n\r\nShe’s 103 and Just Ran the 100-Meter Dash. Her Life Advice? ‘Look for Magic Moments’\r\nIn the Queens race, Ms. Cabán has amassed by far the largest number of individual donors — more than 5,000 total and more than 1,100 in Queens — using regular email solicitations.\r\n\r\nMs. Cabán, a public defender, has refused money from New York City’s typical donor class — businesses, lobbyists and real estate interests — and made that a key part of her campaign. She has linked her run to a nationwide effort to reform prosecutors’ offices that has seen recent success in Philadelphia and the Virginia suburbs of Washington, in part with funds from Mr. Soros.\r\n</p><p>\r\nMonica Klein, a campaign spokeswoman, said it was “no surprise” that Ms. Cabán has attracted support from around the country: “there’s a national movement to transform a broken justice system.”\r\n\r\nSenators Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, both Democratic presidential candidates, endorsed Ms. Cabán on Wednesday. Mr. Sanders did so in an email that also solicited donations for her.\r\n\r\nOn Friday, the criminal justice reform group funded by Mr. Soros, Justice and Public Safety PAC, entered the Queens race: a $70,000 contribution to the Working Families Party, whose members have been actively assisting Ms. Cabán.\r\n\r\nThe Working Families Party expects to spend close to $250,000 on the race, according to Bill Lipton, the party’s political director.\r\n\r\n“Taking money from the real estate industry has become a fault line in politics for working class and progressive voters — a marker for who you can trust,” Mr. Lipton said.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThose comments were an unsubtle attack on Ms. Katz, the borough president. A veteran politician with deep Queens ties, Ms. Katz had been seen as such a front-runner that a local politics magazine, City and State, put her on the cover on Monday: “Katz in the bag,” the headline read.\r\n\r\nMelinda Katz, the Queens borough president, has gotten endorsements and donations from major labor unions and other traditional Democratic institutions.\r\nCredit\r\nMary Altaffer/Associated Press\r\n\r\n\r\nImageMelinda Katz, the Queens borough president, has gotten endorsements and donations from major labor unions and other traditional Democratic institutions.\r\nMelinda Katz, the Queens borough president, has gotten endorsements and donations from major labor unions and other traditional Democratic institutions.CreditMary Altaffer/Associated Press\r\nShe entered the year with more than $850,000 on hand, and has raised about $1 million since. She has taken checks of $5,000 or more from developers and landlords; from unions for hotel workers, painters and police captains; from allies of Mr. Cuomo; from the political action committee of Carl E. Heastie, the State Assembly speaker.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe checks are large and largely local: 80 percent of the 390 individual donors who gave Ms. Katz money from mid-January through the latest filing had New York City ZIP codes. Slightly more than half were from Queens.\r\n\r\nGrant Fox, a spokesman for Ms. Katz, said her support “among the working men and women of our city” and among many of the biggest unions “will make the difference on the ground in Queens.”\r\n\r\nAnother candidate in the race has received strong support from inside New York City and its suburbs: Greg Lasak, a former chief prosecutor in the Queens district attorney’s office and state court judge.\r\n\r\nNearly 97 percent of his donors listed an address in New York State. Mr. Lasak has raised more than $1.3 million, including large sums from law firms, the city’s largest police union and from associations for court officers and clerks.\r\n\r\nBill Driscoll, the chairman of Mr. Lasak’s campaign, attributed the support to the candidate’s experience.\r\n\r\nGreg Lasak, a former chief prosecutor in the Queens district attorney’s office, has received the overwhelming majority of his campaign donations from New York State.\r\nCredit\r\nMary Altaffer/Associated Press\r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nImage\r\nGreg Lasak, a former chief prosecutor in the Queens district attorney’s office, has received the overwhelming majority of his campaign donations from New York State.\r\nGreg Lasak, a former chief prosecutor in the Queens district attorney’s office, has received the overwhelming majority of his campaign donations from New York State.CreditMary Altaffer/Associated Press\r\nIn the final days of the race, big checks have flowed mostly to Ms. Katz, who as of Sunday had taken in more than $235,000 in contributions over $1,000. The largest donations came from the United Federation of Teachers ($36,000), the real estate developer and financier Howard Milstein ($26,000), and Joe for NY ($12,500) — a state committee for the former Queens congressman Joseph Crowley, who lost his seat last year to Ms. Ocasio-Cortez.\r\n</p><p>\r\nSince the latest filing, Ms. Cabán reported no check greater than $1,000 — and those under that amount are not reported in daily filings. But the Working Families Party, which is supporting her, received $125,000 as of Sunday. (Mr. Lasak collected an additional $85,000.)\r\n\r\nMs. Cabán is not bereft of large contributors, including $38,505 from Cale Bonderman, a Brooklyn-based 26-year-old son of a billionaire investor, and $38,000 from Elizabeth Simons, whose address is in California.\r\n\r\nMs. Ocasio-Cortez helped raise $14,000 for Ms. Cabán in just a few hours on the day of her endorsement after she sent an email blast soliciting donations.\r\n\r\nMs. Katz, with her steakhouse fund-raiser, did far better. The invite list for that event, at Delmonico’s restaurant near Wall Street, included some prominent lobbyists in Albany and New York City, and the Rent Stabilization Association, a landlord group.\r\n\r\nShe raised over $50,000, according to her campaign, a sum perhaps driven by the top billing of Mr. Cuomo as the special guest — no doubt attracting some of his supporters and donors.\r\n\r\nThey would have left disappointed: The governor did not attend.\r\n\r\n', 'J.

Peering through a microscope, he studied their cusps and ridges. “Within 5 minutes, I could tell,” he said. These were the teeth of ancient hyenas — specifically Chasmaporthetes, or “running hyenas,” known for their speed and endurance.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAlthough only four hyena species exist today, the prehistoric world was full of them: nearly 70 species are currently known to have once roamed the planet. Signs of running hyenas specifically have been found across the southern United States and Mexico, as well as in Africa, Asia and Europe.\r\n\r\nBut these teeth, officially identified Tuesday in the journal Open Quaternary, provide the first evidence that hyenas also lived north of the Arctic Circle.

In 2017, Dr. Tseng helped to describe two new species of prehistoric beardog based on previously discovered skulls.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe hyena find came from a decades-long game of scientific telephone. In the 1970s, two sets of researchers each found a tooth in the Yukon Territory’s Old Crow Basin, an area so paleontologically generous that some have described it as a “supermarket for fossils,” Dr. Tseng said. In the past, the basin has coughed up evidence of giant camels, proto-wild dogs and Pleistocene peccaries, expanding each species’ previously known range.\r\n\r\nSuspecting the tooth she found had belonged to a hyena, Brenda Beebe, a paleontologist at the University of Toronto, sent photos and details to another expert, Björn Kurtén of Finland, who filed the correspondence away. After Dr. Kurtén died in 1988, his former student, Lars Werdelin, found Dr. Beebe’s letter.\r\n</p><p>\r\nHe, too, forgot about it until a couple of years ago, when it resurfaced “during an office move,” said Dr. Werdelin, one of the paper’s co-authors. He then told Dr. Tseng, who headed to Ottawa to see the teeth for himself.\r\n\r\nDr. Tseng’s identification is convincing, and the study “fills an important gap in our understanding” of ancient hyena dispersal, said Duane Froese, an environmental scientist at the University of Alberta who was not involved in the research.\r\n\r\n“It’s tremendously cool to think of hyenas in the Arctic,” he said.\r\n</p><p>\r\nMysteries remain. After all, “it’s just two teeth,” said Dr. Tseng. But they serve as points on which to hang informed speculation. In the team’s renderings, they imagine the hyenas with white fur, for camouflage in the Arctic ice. And because Chasmaporthetes were likely strong enough to crack bones, they may have played an important nutrient-recycling role in the prehistoric ecosystem, breaking down the carcasses of large animals like mammoths, caribou and horses.\r\n\r\nA question of national pride, though, is finally settled. “Americans had the hyenas,” said Dr. Tseng, and now Canada has them too.

Its Bookstore Offers', 'SPERRYVILLE, Va. — “The Sanford Guide to Antimicrobial Therapy” is a medical handbook that recommends the right amount of the right drug for treating ailments from bacterial pneumonia to infected wounds. Lives depend on it.\r\n</p><p>\r\nIt is not the sort of book a doctor should puzzle over, wondering, “Is that a ‘1’ or a ‘7’ in the recommended dosage?” But that is exactly the possibility that has haunted the guide’s publisher, Antimicrobial Therapy, for the past two years as it confronted a flood of counterfeits — many of which were poorly printed and hard to read — in Amazon’s vast bookstore.\r\n</p><p>\r\n“This threatens a bunch of patients — and our whole business,” said Scott Kelly, the publisher’s vice president.\r\n\r\nMr. Kelly’s problems arise directly from Amazon’s domination of the book business. The company sells substantially more than half of the books in the United States, including new and used physical volumes as well as digital and audio formats. Amazon is also a platform for third-party sellers, a publisher, a printer, a self-publisher, a review hub, a textbook supplier and a distributor that now runs its own chain of brick-and-mortar stores.\r\n</p><p>\r\nInterested in All Things Tech?\r\nThe Bits newsletter will keep you updated on the latest from Silicon Valley and the technology industry.\r\n\r\nSIGN UP\r\nBut Amazon takes a hands-off approach to what goes on in its bookstore, never checking the authenticity, much less the quality, of what it sells. It does not oversee the sellers who have flocked to its site in any organized way.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThat has resulted in a kind of lawlessness. Publishers, writers and groups such as the Authors Guild said counterfeiting of books on Amazon had surged. The company has been reactive rather than proactive in dealing with the issue, they said, often taking action only when a buyer complains. Many times, they added, there is nowhere to appeal and their only recourse is to integrate even more closely with Amazon.\r\n\r\nThe scope of counterfeiting across Amazon goes far beyond books. E-commerce has taken counterfeit goods from flea markets to the mainstream, and Amazon is by far the e-commerce heavyweight. But books offer a way to see the depths of the issue.\r\n</p><p>\r\n“Being a tech monopoly means you don’t have to care about quality,” said Bill Pollock, a San Francisco publisher who has dealt with fake versions of his firm’s computer books on Amazon.\r\n\r\nAn Amazon spokeswoman denied that counterfeiting of books was a problem, saying, “This report cites a handful of complaints, but even a handful is too many and we will keep working until it’s zero.” The company said it strictly prohibited counterfeit products and last year denied accounts to more than one million suspected “bad actors.”\r\n</p><p>\r\nHow a Dallas Photojournalist Captured an Image of a Gunman Mid-Attack\r\n\r\nGiant Squid, Phantom of the Deep, Reappears on Video\r\n“There is strong competition amongst booksellers, from major retailers to independent booksellers,” the spokeswoman added.\r\n\r\nWhat happens after a tech giant dominates an industry is increasingly a question as lawmakers and regulators begin taking a harder look at technology companies, asking when dominance shades into a monopoly. This month, lawmakers in the House said they were scrutinizing the tech giants’ possible anticompetitive behavior. And the Federal Trade Commission is specifically examining Amazon.\r\n</p><p>\r\nIn Amazon’s bookstore, the unruly behavior has been widespread, aided by print-on-demand technology. Booksellers that seem to have no verifiable existence outside Amazon offer $10 books for $100 or even $1,000 on the site, raising suspicions of algorithms run wild or even money-laundering. The problem of fake reviews is so bad that the F.T.C. has already gotten involved.\r\n\r\nThose who write a popular book open themselves up to being “summarized” on Amazon. At least eight books purport to summarize “Bad Blood,” John Carreyrou’s best-selling account of fraud in Silicon Valley. The popular novel “Where the Crawdads Sing” has at least seven summaries. “Discover a beautiful coming-of-age story without all of the unnecessary information included in the actual novel!” says one that has 19 five-star reviews, all of which read as if they were fake.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAnd then there are the counterfeits.\r\n\r\nA counterfeit version of Danielle Trussoni’s acclaimed memoir, “Falling Through the Earth,” on Amazon misspelled the author’s name on the cover.\r\n“It’s unacceptable and I’m furious,” the author Andrew Sean Greer tweeted after people complained last summer that fakes of his Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, “Less,” were being sold as the real thing. There was a counterfeit edition of Danielle Trussoni’s acclaimed memoir, “Falling Through the Earth,” on the site that misspelled her name on the cover. Lauren Groff tweeted that there was “an illegal paperback” of “Florida,” her National Book Award nominee, on Amazon.\r\n</p><p>\r\nDead writers get hit, too. Arthur Miller’s “The Crucible” was pirated. So was a volume of classic stories by Jorge Luis Borges. For 18 months Amazon has sold a counterfeit of Agatha Christie’s “Murder on the Orient Express” despite warnings in reader reviews that it is a “monstrosity,” dispensing with such standard features as proofreading and paragraph indenting.\r\n</p><p>\r\nTechnical books, which tend to be more expensive than fiction, are frequent victims. No Starch Press has tried to squelch fake editions of its computer manuals for three years. Mr. Pollock, No Starch’s founder, said Amazon had the same laid-back approach to bad actors on its platform as Facebook and YouTube.\r\n\r\n“Amazon is the Wild Wild West,” he said.\r\n\r\nAmazon has sold a counterfeit version of Agatha Christie’s “Murder on the Orient Express” despite reader reviews warning that it is “maybe even a fake?”\r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nImage\r\nAmazon has sold a counterfeit version of Agatha Christie’s “Murder on the Orient Express” despite reader reviews warning that it is “maybe even a fake?”\r\nAmazon has sold a counterfeit version of Agatha Christie’s “Murder on the Orient Express” despite reader reviews warning that it is “maybe even a fake?”\r\nThis is not really negligence on Amazon’s part. It is the company’s business model. Amazon, which does not break out revenue or profit from bookselling or publishing, assumes that everyone on its platform operates in good faith until proven otherwise. “It is your responsibility to ensure that your content doesn’t violate laws or copyright, trademark, privacy, publicity or other rights,” it tells prospective publishers and sellers.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAt Antimicrobial Therapy, the first warning that something was amiss with the Sanford Guide came with reviews on Amazon. “Several pages smudged and unable to read,” one buyer said in 2017, posting photos as proof. “Seems as the book was photocopied,” said a second. “Characters are smeared,” wrote a third.\r\n\r\nThe company, whose books were sold to Amazon by distributors, did test buys. It got some copies from Amazon and others from its third-party sellers, including UsedText4u, Robinhood Book Foundation and 24x7 Book. Of the 34 books that Mr. Kelly bought, at least 30 were counterfeit. None of the booksellers responded to requests for comment.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe first warning that there might be problems with copies of the Sanford Guide available on Amazon came in the form of customer reviews.\r\n\r\n\r\nImage\r\nThe first warning that there might be problems with copies of the Sanford Guide available on Amazon came in the form of customer reviews.\r\nThe first warning that there might be problems with copies of the Sanford Guide available on Amazon came in the form of customer reviews.\r\nMr. Kelly spent hours writing responses to customers who complained about their copies but didn’t realize they had counterfeits. He tried tracking down the source of the fakes and attempted to communicate with Amazon. Eventually he wrote to the retailer’s founder, Jeff Bezos, saying, “Amazon is knowingly and willfully fulfilling most orders for our title with counterfeits that may contain errors leading to injury or death of their patients.”\r\n\r\nMr. Kelly got a response two weeks later from “Raj,” a member of “the Amazon Seller Performance team.” Raj said that an unnamed third-party seller had been barred from selling the book but that the seller might now appeal directly to AMT, and that if the company wanted to retract the whole thing, here was what to do.\r\n</p><p>\r\n“They were very reluctant to actually engage with us about the problem,” Mr. Kelly said of Amazon.\r\n\r\nThe Authors Guild said it was also seeing “a massive rise” in counterfeit books. “Authors tell us, ‘I know I had more sales, but I don’t see them in my royalties.’” said Mary Rasenberger, the guild’s executive director. “Amazon owns the reseller platform, and we think that’s where these books are being sold.”\r\n\r\nIn February, Amazon included counterfeiting in its financial disclosures as a risk factor for the first time, saying it might not be able to prevent its merchants “from selling unlawful, counterfeit, pirated or stolen goods” or “selling goods in an unlawful or unethical manner.”\r\n\r\nYet the company has such a grip on books that counterfeits do not seem to harm it. They might even increase its business.\r\n</p><p>\r\n“A book takes a year or more to write,” said Andrew Hunt of the Pragmatic Bookshelf, a North Carolina publisher of computer books that had at least one of its titles stolen. “But to steal the book and upload it to Amazon takes only a minute. As the expression goes, there’s a low cost of entry.”\r\n\r\nAn original 2018 copy of “The Sanford Guide to Antimicrobial Therapy,” left, and a counterfeit that was available on Amazon.\r\nCredit\r\nIsabelle Baldwin for The New York Times\r\n\r\n\r\nImage\r\nAn original 2018 copy of “The Sanford Guide to Antimicrobial Therapy,” left, and a counterfeit that was available on Amazon.\r\nAn original 2018 copy of “The Sanford Guide to Antimicrobial Therapy,” left, and a counterfeit that was available on Amazon.CreditIsabelle Baldwin for The New York Times\r\nAnd when someone buys a counterfeit, Mr. Hunt added, the real author may get cheated but Amazon still makes a sale. “You could ask, What’s their incentive to do something?” he said.\r\n</p><p>\r\nA dream turns into something else\r\nAmazon fulfilled Jamie Lendino’s dream of becoming an author.\r\n\r\nA computer buff who delights in the digital past, Mr. Lendino, 45, wrote a book called “Breakout,” about the Atari machines of the 1980s that ushered in a new era of gaming. He self-published it two years ago through Amazon, which charged him nothing upfront but took a commission on the 1,223 paperback copies bought by devoted Atari fans.\r\n\r\nThen Amazon fulfilled someone’s dream of becoming Jamie Lendino.\r\n\r\nA fellow purportedly named Steve S.

(35, 'international', 'Trump’s Iran Reversal Raises Allies’ Over His Tactics, and U.S. Power', 'BERLIN — Some framed it as another empty threat from a leader whose bark is consistently worse than his bite. Some saw a method to the perceived madness — a potentially shrewd act of brinkmanship.\r\n\r\nAnd others considered it simply the latest act of an America that, long before President Trump, has often oscillated from isolation to intervention, and back.\r\n\r\nMr. Trump’s order to attack Iran on Thursday in retaliation for its downing of a spy drone, and his abrupt reversal minutes before American forces carried it out, have intensified global doubts about the president’s judgment and the power wielded by the United States.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of erratic decision-making “adds to the confusion of his allies and adversaries,” said Nigel Sheinwald, a former British ambassador to Washington who once conducted hostage negotiations with the Iranian government.\r\n\r\nSign up for The Interpreter\r\nSubscribe for original insights, commentary and discussions on the major news stories of the week, from columnists Max Fisher and Amanda Taub.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nSIGN UP\r\nBut it is also part of “a continuing picture of American uncertainty about the use of power,” Mr. Sheinwald said. “It is the leitmotif that runs throughout U.S. history.”\r\n\r\nIf leaders of Britain, France and Germany — America’s main European allies — saw Mr. Trump’s aborted attack as a point of no return for his own reputation, or for the United States’ global standing, they did their best to hide it.\r\n\r\nSince Thursday night, the public response of Western politicians has been largely cautious, sometimes confused — but only implicitly critical.</p>\r\n<p>President Emmanuel Macron of France, who earlier in the week had sent an envoy to negotiate with Iran, on Friday invited both the United States and Iran “to reason, to de-escalation and now to discussion.”\r\n\r\nOn Saturday, the British government called for dialogue and sent a junior minister to Tehran to meet with Iranian officials.

(36, 'business', 'What Happens After Amazon’s Domination Complete? Its Bookstore Offers', 'SPERRYVILLE, Va. — “The Sanford Guide to Antimicrobial Therapy” is a medical handbook that recommends the right amount of the right drug for treating ailments from bacterial pneumonia to infected wounds. Lives depend on it.\r\n</p><p>\r\nIt is not the sort of book a doctor should puzzle over, wondering, “Is that a ‘1’ or a ‘7’ in the recommended dosage?” But that is exactly the possibility that has haunted the guide’s publisher, Antimicrobial Therapy, for the past two years as it confronted a flood of counterfeits — many of which were poorly printed and hard to read — in Amazon’s vast bookstore.\r\n</p><p>\r\n“This threatens a bunch of patients — and our whole business,” said Scott Kelly, the publisher’s vice president.\r\n\r\nMr. Kelly’s problems arise directly from Amazon’s domination of the book business. The company sells substantially more than half of the books in the United States, including new and used physical volumes as well as digital and audio formats. Amazon is also a platform for third-party sellers, a publisher, a printer, a self-publisher, a review hub, a textbook supplier and a distributor that now runs its own chain of brick-and-mortar stores.\r\n</p><p>\r\nInterested in All Things Tech?\r\nThe Bits newsletter will keep you updated on the latest from Silicon Valley and the technology industry.\r\n\r\nSIGN UP\r\nBut Amazon takes a hands-off approach to what goes on in its bookstore, never checking the authenticity, much less the quality, of what it sells. It does not oversee the sellers who have flocked to its site in any organized way.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThat has resulted in a kind of lawlessness. Publishers, writers and groups such as the Authors Guild said counterfeiting of books on Amazon had surged. The company has been reactive rather than proactive in dealing with the issue, they said, often taking action only when a buyer complains. Many times, they added, there is nowhere to appeal and their only recourse is to integrate even more closely with Amazon.\r\n\r\nThe scope of counterfeiting across Amazon goes far beyond books. E-commerce has taken counterfeit goods from flea markets to the mainstream, and Amazon is by far the e-commerce heavyweight. But books offer a way to see the depths of the issue.\r\n</p><p>\r\n“Being a tech monopoly means you don’t have to care about quality,” said Bill Pollock, a San Francisco publisher who has dealt with fake versions of his firm’s computer books on Amazon.\r\n\r\nAn Amazon spokeswoman denied that counterfeiting of books was a problem, saying, “This report cites a handful of complaints, but even a handful is too many and we will keep working until it’s zero.” The company said it strictly prohibited counterfeit products and last year denied accounts to more than one million suspected “bad actors.”\r\n</p><p>\r\nHow a Dallas Photojournalist Captured an Image of a Gunman Mid-Attack\r\n\r\nGiant Squid, Phantom of the Deep, Reappears on Video\r\n“There is strong competition amongst booksellers, from major retailers to independent booksellers,” the spokeswoman added.\r\n\r\nWhat happens after a tech giant dominates an industry is increasingly a question as lawmakers and regulators begin taking a harder look at technology companies, asking when dominance shades into a monopoly. This month, lawmakers in the House said they were scrutinizing the tech giants’ possible anticompetitive behavior. And the Federal Trade Commission is specifically examining Amazon.\r\n</p><p>\r\nIn Amazon’s bookstore, the unruly behavior has been widespread, aided by print-on-demand technology. Booksellers that seem to have no verifiable existence outside Amazon offer $10 books for $100 or even $1,000 on the site, raising suspicions of algorithms run wild or even money-laundering. The problem of fake reviews is so bad that the F.T.C. has already gotten involved.\r\n\r\nThose who write a popular book open themselves up to being “summarized” on Amazon. At least eight books purport to summarize “Bad Blood,” John Carreyrou’s best-selling account of fraud in Silicon Valley. The popular novel “Where the Crawdads Sing” has at least seven summaries. “Discover a beautiful coming-of-age story without all of the unnecessary information included in the actual novel!” says one that has 19 five-star reviews, all of which read as if they were fake.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAnd then there are the counterfeits.\r\n\r\nA counterfeit version of Danielle Trussoni’s acclaimed memoir, “Falling Through the Earth,” on Amazon misspelled the author’s name on the cover.\r\n“It’s unacceptable and I’m furious,” the author Andrew Sean Greer tweeted after people complained last summer that fakes of his Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, “Less,” were being sold as the real thing. There was a counterfeit edition of Danielle Trussoni’s acclaimed memoir, “Falling Through the Earth,” on the site that misspelled her name on the cover. Lauren Groff tweeted that there was “an illegal paperback” of “Florida,” her National Book Award nominee, on Amazon.\r\n</p><p>\r\nDead writers get hit, too. Arthur Miller’s “The Crucible” was pirated. So was a volume of classic stories by Jorge Luis Borges. For 18 months Amazon has sold a counterfeit of Agatha Christie’s “Murder on the Orient Express” despite warnings in reader reviews that it is a “monstrosity,” dispensing with such standard features as proofreading and paragraph indenting.\r\n</p><p>\r\nTechnical books, which tend to be more expensive than fiction, are frequent victims. No Starch Press has tried to squelch fake editions of its computer manuals for three years. Mr. Pollock, No Starch’s founder, said Amazon had the same laid-back approach to bad actors on its platform as Facebook and YouTube.\r\n\r\n“Amazon is the Wild Wild West,” he said.\r\n\r\nAmazon has sold a counterfeit version of Agatha Christie’s “Murder on the Orient Express” despite reader reviews warning that it is “maybe even a fake?”\r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nImage\r\nAmazon has sold a counterfeit version of Agatha Christie’s “Murder on the Orient Express” despite reader reviews warning that it is “maybe even a fake?”\r\nAmazon has sold a counterfeit version of Agatha Christie’s “Murder on the Orient Express” despite reader reviews warning that it is “maybe even a fake?”\r\nThis is not really negligence on Amazon’s part. It is the company’s business model. Amazon, which does not break out revenue or profit from bookselling or publishing, assumes that everyone on its platform operates in good faith until proven otherwise. “It is your responsibility to ensure that your content doesn’t violate laws or copyright, trademark, privacy, publicity or other rights,” it tells prospective publishers and sellers.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAt Antimicrobial Therapy, the first warning that something was amiss with the Sanford Guide came with reviews on Amazon. “Several pages smudged and unable to read,” one buyer said in 2017, posting photos as proof. “Seems as the book was photocopied,” said a second. “Characters are smeared,” wrote a third.\r\n\r\nThe company, whose books were sold to Amazon by distributors, did test buys. It got some copies from Amazon and others from its third-party sellers, including UsedText4u, Robinhood Book Foundation and 24x7 Book. Of the 34 books that Mr. Kelly bought, at least 30 were counterfeit. None of the booksellers responded to requests for comment.\r\n</p><p>\r\nThe first warning that there might be problems with copies of the Sanford Guide available on Amazon came in the form of customer reviews.\r\n\r\n\r\nImage\r\nThe first warning that there might be problems with copies of the Sanford Guide available on Amazon came in the form of customer reviews.\r\nThe first warning that there might be problems with copies of the Sanford Guide available on Amazon came in the form of customer reviews.\r\nMr. Kelly spent hours writing responses to customers who complained about their copies but didn’t realize they had counterfeits. He tried tracking down the source of the fakes and attempted to communicate with Amazon. Eventually he wrote to the retailer’s founder, Jeff Bezos, saying, “Amazon is knowingly and willfully fulfilling most orders for our title with counterfeits that may contain errors leading to injury or death of their patients.”\r\n\r\nMr. Kelly got a response two weeks later from “Raj,” a member of “the Amazon Seller Performance team.” Raj said that an unnamed third-party seller had been barred from selling the book but that the seller might now appeal directly to AMT, and that if the company wanted to retract the whole thing, here was what to do.\r\n</p><p>\r\n“They were very reluctant to actually engage with us about the problem,” Mr. Kelly said of Amazon.\r\n\r\nThe Authors Guild said it was also seeing “a massive rise” in counterfeit books. “Authors tell us, ‘I know I had more sales, but I don’t see them in my royalties.’” said Mary Rasenberger, the guild’s executive director. “Amazon owns the reseller platform, and we think that’s where these books are being sold.”\r\n\r\nIn February, Amazon included counterfeiting in its financial disclosures as a risk factor for the first time, saying it might not be able to prevent its merchants “from selling unlawful, counterfeit, pirated or stolen goods” or “selling goods in an unlawful or unethical manner.”\r\n\r\nYet the company has such a grip on books that counterfeits do not seem to harm it. They might even increase its business.\r\n</p><p>\r\n“A book takes a year or more to write,” said Andrew Hunt of the Pragmatic Bookshelf, a North Carolina publisher of computer books that had at least one of its titles stolen. “But to steal the book and upload it to Amazon takes only a minute. As the expression goes, there’s a low cost of entry.”\r\n\r\nAn original 2018 copy of “The Sanford Guide to Antimicrobial Therapy,” left, and a counterfeit that was available on Amazon.\r\nCredit\r\nIsabelle Baldwin for The New York Times\r\n\r\n\r\nImage\r\nAn original 2018 copy of “The Sanford Guide to Antimicrobial Therapy,” left, and a counterfeit that was available on Amazon.\r\nAn original 2018 copy of “The Sanford Guide to Antimicrobial Therapy,” left, and a counterfeit that was available on Amazon.CreditIsabelle Baldwin for The New York Times\r\nAnd when someone buys a counterfeit, Mr. Hunt added, the real author may get cheated but Amazon still makes a sale. “You could ask, What’s their incentive to do something?” he said.\r\n</p><p>\r\nA dream turns into something else\r\nAmazon fulfilled Jamie Lendino’s dream of becoming an author.\r\n\r\nA computer buff who delights in the digital past, Mr. Lendino, 45, wrote a book called “Breakout,” about the Atari machines of the 1980s that ushered in a new era of gaming.

(37, 'national', 'Maine Needed New, Young Residents. African Migrants Arriving by the Dozens.', 'PORTLAND, Me. — Through the winter, the families streamed into Portland, bringing stories of violence and persecution in their home countries in central Africa. Portland’s shelter for homeless families soon filled to capacity, so the city put mats on the floor of a Salvation Army gym for 80 more people.\r\n\r\nThen that, too, wasn’t enough. This month, 250 migrants from Africa arrived in this northeastern city of roughly 67,000 residents in the span of just a week, overflowing the overflow space and forcing Portland to hastily convert a basketball arena into an emergency shelter. Urgent calls went out for interpreters who could speak French, Portuguese and Lingala, a language spoken in the Democratic Republic of Congo. City Council meetings were given over to grappling with how Portland would pay for all of this — and the possibility that still more migrants might be coming.\r\n\r\nIt is a bit of a mystery in Maine, one of the oldest and whitest states in the country, how Portland has become a focal point for a sudden surge of migrants, mostly from Angola and Congo, who are seeking asylum.\r\n\r\nMaine has long wrestled with an aging work force, and some leaders view immigrants as a welcome answer to the state’s struggles to lure younger people to live and work here. Still, the sheer numbers — and the suddenness of the latest arrivals — have opened up a debate about how much Portland should be doing to help immigrants and whether it should entice more of them to come.\r\n\r\nSign Up for The Daily Newsletter\r\nEvery Friday, get an exclusive look at how one of the week’s biggest news stories on “The Daily” podcast came together.\r\n\r\nSIGN UP\r\n“I love the fact that these folks are coming here, and they want a better life, and they’ve chosen Portland,” Jon Jennings, the city manager, said. “But at the same time, I’ve got to figure out how to pay to pave streets and fix sidewalks and all of the things that are uniquely responsible to a municipal government.”\r\n\r\nThere is friction over the issue, even inside City Hall.\r\n\r\n“If we have discovered the magic wand that will bring young families to Portland to help us build the next generation, why would we want to stop that, especially when it costs us so little money?” Ethan Strimling, Portland’s mayor, said.\r\n\r\nThe migrants arriving in this city have undergone a grueling journey, traveling by air or sea to South America, and then north on foot and by bus to the southern border of the United States, where most of them were arrested by border officials and released with notices to appear in immigration court after they declared their intention to seek asylum.\r\n\r\nNearly 800 migrants from Africa have been apprehended on one stretch of the Texas border and released by authorities since the beginning of October; the surge surprised and puzzled immigration officials, who are more accustomed to seeing Central American families crossing the border. Hundreds of African migrants arrived just this month and were taken to San Antonio, where Catholic Charities provided bus tickets to Portland and other cities that the migrants named as their destinations.\r\n\r\nEditors’ Picks\r\n\r\nHow a Dallas Photojournalist Captured an Image of a Gunman Mid-Attack\r\n\r\nGiant Squid, Phantom of the Deep, Reappears on Video\r\nAmong Portland’s residents and even some of the families arriving from Africa, it is uncertain how this place became such a draw.\r\n\r\nMore than 200 asylum seekers are now staying at the Expo, a municipally owned basketball arena in Portland.\r\nCredit\r\nTristan Spinski for The New York Times\r\n\r\n\r\nImageMore than 200 asylum seekers are now staying at the Expo, a municipally owned basketball arena in Portland.\r\nMore than 200 asylum seekers are now staying at the Expo, a municipally owned basketball arena in Portland.CreditTristan Spinski for The New York Times\r\nMr. Strimling, the mayor, has been an outspoken advocate for welcoming immigrants. In April, when President Trump wrote on Twitter that his administration was considering sending detained immigrants to so-called sanctuary cities, Mr. Strimling responded: “If he wants to send more immigrants our way, bring them on.”\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Jennings, who runs the day-to-day operations of Portland, expressed concern about the costs of aiding everyone, and criticized the mayor for having essentially invited asylum seekers to come here.\r\n\r\nImmigrants who are seeking asylum are not permitted to work until at least six months after they file their asylum applications, so Portland has scrambled to provide support. Helped by $400,000 in donations, the city has given emergency assistance to roughly 300 people in recent weeks.\r\n\r\n“If you started to see double that or more, I’m not sure how we would be able to handle that,” Mr. Jennings said. “That’s why I think we’ve got to be careful with the messaging and everything that we say publicly.”\r\n\r\nInside the Expo, the basketball arena now filled with 200 cots, families gave varying reasons for choosing Portland, a city that is 81 percent white but that already has a sizable community of immigrants from Africa, including from Congo and Angola. About 13 percent of the city’s population is foreign born, according to census data, many of those residents from Somalia.\r\n\r\nGloire Kikweta, 24, who came from Congo with his wife and two children — the younger of whom was born in Brazil on their way here — said he had left his home because he was being pursued by law enforcement for participating in protests against the former president, Joseph Kabila. He said he did not have a plan of where to go in the United States, but when he was in San Antonio, African immigrants there advised him to go to Portland, telling him that it was an aging city that needed more people, and that it was safe.\r\n\r\nVincent Mbala, 32, who is also from Congo, and came with his wife and three children, said that he learned through internet research that Maine provided financial support for asylum seekers. Maine is unusual in providing general assistance, for up to two years, to immigrants who have valid visas or who have applied for asylum. In most states, asylum seekers rely on local nonprofit groups for aid until they can work, and in many cases struggle to afford housing and food.\r\n\r\nPortland also has what local officials believe is the only municipal fund in the country that provides support to asylum seekers before they submit their applications. Called the Community Support Fund, the program was created in 2015 when the Republican former governor, Paul R. LePage, was trying to cut off asylum seekers from the state’s general assistance program. Maine’s new governor, Janet Mills, a Democrat, visited Portland’s shelter in recent weeks and has pledged to help the city financially.\r\n\r\nAround Portland, many residents have greeted the migrants enthusiastically. More than 1,200 people have volunteered to help at the Expo. Leaders in the city’s African immigrant community have mobilized people to serve as interpreters and to cook meals for the migrants.\r\n\r\nComplaints, too, have come. Some Portland residents said that the city needed to focus more on local needs. The views reflected strains caused by Portland’s recent success in attracting another group — young professionals from other states — whose presence has driven up rents even as it has fueled the local economy.\r\n\r\nThis year, Mr. Jennings, the city manager, proposed that Portland phase out the municipal fund for asylum seekers. In a recent interview, he said he believed it was one reason migrants were coming here.\r\n\r\nSome of the migrants have friends or relatives in Portland. Others said they had heard that the city was welcoming to immigrants.\r\nCredit\r\nTristan Spinski for The New York Times\r\n\r\n\r\nImage\r\nSome of the migrants have friends or relatives in Portland.

Others said they had heard that the city was welcoming to immigrants.CreditTristan Spinski for The New York Times\r\nThe $200,000 fund was already overspent this year by April. The City Council is currently debating whether the fund should be available to anyone who arrives, no matter when, or if it should be limited, given the sudden surge of people.\r\n\r\nThe city has estimated that it would cost roughly $1.4 million to provide housing vouchers and other support to all the families currently staying at the Expo for a year.\r\n\r\nMr. Strimling, who recently announced he is seeking re-election as mayor, said he wanted to keep the fund open to anyone who needed it. He said that he doubted many migrants were coming to Portland because they had heard about the fund, but that, if they were, it was all the more reason to keep it going.\r\n\r\nIn East Bayside, a Portland neighborhood where some immigrants have settled in recent years, Roderic Morgan, 74, said the city had enough to deal with in taking care of the homeless population without extending help to asylum seekers. He also expressed concern that there were not enough jobs to go around.\r\n\r\nIn fact, many businesses in Maine say they struggle to find workers to fill jobs. The unemployment rate in Maine is 3.3 percent, and in the Portland metropolitan region, 2.6 percent. Both are lower than the national rate of 3.6 percent.\r\n\r\nAsked how he thought immigrants had changed Portland, Mr. Morgan, a retired newspaper deliveryman, raised a different issue.\r\n\r\n“It’s not just the immigrants that have invaded Portland,” he said. Well-off people from other places were moving to Portland and making the city unaffordable, he said.\r\n\r\nIn Parkside, not far from the Expo, Timothy Goldkin, 29, called it a “beautiful thing” to have more diversity in Maine. Mr. Goldkin, who has a housemate who is an asylum seeker, said he would rather have more immigrants in Portland than wealthy people migrating from other states and changing the city’s landscape and culture.\r\n\r\n“I’m much more worried about the people with lots of money who want to just completely make it their town, with zero regard to what it was,” he said, “than the folks who are fleeing persecution and in fear of their life and who are coming here to try to understand our culture and integrate into it, while still holding onto and bringing some of their own loveliness.”\r\n\r\nFor now, a major challenge for the city is to find permanent housing for the scores of families staying at the Expo and another shelter. Neighboring cities have agreed to help identify vacancies, and Mr. Jennings said that a lumber company in Jackman, three hours north of Portland, had reached out with an offer to house some of the families in Jackman if they were interested in working for the company.\r\n\r\n“I’ve had people all over the state inquire about whether some of these folks could come to other parts of the state, because they need qualified workers,” Mr. Jennings said. “They need new people.”', 'Kate Taylor', 436, 0, '2019-06-24 07:58:12', '2019-06-24-075812maine-needed-new-young-residents-african-migrants-arriving-by-the-dozens', 0, 'assets/images/articles/main_news/merlin_156742482_dbf7a31c-e2b3-40a3-9205-f2f16623b437-superJumbo.jpg', 'image description by demo', 1, '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

Some want to eliminate private insurance, but many others said that was a step too far.\r\n“Medicare for all” is the hottest idea in the Democratic presidential race for overhauling the nation’s health care system, and it is a phrase quite likely to be heard repeatedly at the first debates this week. But despite all the buzz, it turns out that the concept is dividing the 2020 field.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nA new survey of the Democratic candidates by The New York Times finds that many of them prefer less sweeping changes than the Medicare for All Act, the single-payer bill introduced by Senator Bernie Sanders and supported by Senator Elizabeth Warren and several other presidential hopefuls. A majority of candidates in the survey — including former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., the leader in early polls — said they would rather add a “public option” in the health care system that would compete with private plans.\r\n\r\nThe public option was once considered too far-reaching — champions of the idea in Congress could not muster quite enough support to include it in the Affordable Care Act in 2010. But it is now seen as a more moderate alternative to Mr. Sanders’s plan, which would all but eliminate private health insurance and enroll everyone in a government-run program.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\nEven some candidates who back the single-payer approach of Medicare for All told The Times they would also be willing to support a choice between some kind of public option and private insurance, an acknowledgment that many Americans like their private coverage and want the choice to keep it.\r\n\r\nSign Up for On Politics With Lisa Lerer\r\nA spotlight on the people reshaping our politics.

While Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren are among the most full-throated supporters of major change, influencing the conversation with their provocative ideas, many other candidates say they are inclined to try to broaden options for health care rather than wholly replace the current system of coverage with a strictly government-run one.\r\n\r\n“We don’t need to blow up our current health care system to provide everyone with high-quality, affordable care,” Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado wrote, explaining his preference for a public option.', 'Abby Goodnough and Trip Gabriel', 10, 0, '2019-06-24 07:18:17', '2019-06-24-071817medicare-for-all-vs-public-option-the-2020-field-split', 0, 'assets/images/articles/main_news/top-chart-Artboard_1_copy_3.jpg', 'image description by demo', 1, '0000-00-00 00:00:00');

(42, 'international', 'Trump Steps Into North Korea and Agrees With Kim Jong-un to Resume Talks', 'SEOUL, South Korea — President Trump became the first sitting American commander in chief to set foot in North Korea on Sunday as he met Kim Jong-un, the country’s leader, at the heavily fortified Demilitarized Zone, and the two agreed to restart negotiations on a long-elusive nuclear agreement.\r\n\r\nGreeted by a beaming Mr. Kim, the president stepped across a low concrete border marker at 3:46 p.m. local time and walked 20 paces to the base of a building on the North Korean side for an unprecedented, camera-friendly demonstration of friendship intended to revitalize stalled talks.\r\n\r\n“It is good to see you again,” an exuberant Mr. Kim told the president through an interpreter. “I never expected to meet you in this place.”\r\n\r\n“Big moment, big moment,” Mr. Trump told him.\r\n</p><p>\r\nAfter about a minute on officially hostile territory, Mr. Trump escorted Mr. Kim back over the line into South Korea, where the two briefly addressed a scrum of journalists before slipping inside the building known as Freedom House for a private conversation along with President Moon Jae-in of South Korea. Mr. Trump said he would invite Mr. Kim to visit him at the White House.\r\n\r\nSign up for The Interpreter\r\nSubscribe for original insights, commentary and discussions on the major news stories of the week, from columnists Max Fisher and Amanda Taub.\r\n\r\nSIGN UP\r\n“This has a lot of significance because it means that we want to bring an end to the unpleasant past and try to create a new future,” Mr. Kim told reporters. “So it’s a very courageous and determined act.”\r\n</p><p>\r\n“Stepping across that line was a great honor,” Mr. Trump replied. “A lot of progress has been made, a lot of friendships have been made, and this has been in particular a great friendship.”\r\n\r\nA showman by nature and past profession, Mr. Trump delighted in the drama of the moment, which he had arranged with a surprise invitation via Twitter barely 24 hours earlier. Never before had American and North Korean leaders gotten together at the military demarcation line, where heavily armed forces have faced off across a tense divide for 66 years since the end of fighting in the Korean War.\r\n\r\nMr. Trump and Mr. Kim meeting on the south side of the demarcation line between North and South Korea on Sunday.\r\nCredit\r\nErin Schaff/The New York Times\r\n\r\n</p><p>\r\nImageMr. Trump and Mr. Kim meeting on the south side of the demarcation line between North and South Korea on Sunday.\r\nMr. Trump and Mr. Kim meeting on the south side of the demarcation line between North and South Korea on Sunday.CreditErin Schaff/The New York Times\r\nThe encounter in Panmunjom had been cast as a brief handshake, not a formal negotiation, but the two ended up together for a little more than an hour. After emerging from their conversation, Mr. Trump said he and Mr. Kim had agreed to designate negotiators to resume talks in the next few weeks, four months after they collapsed at a summit in Hanoi, Vietnam.\r\n\r\nThe American team will still be headed by Stephen Biegun, the special envoy, but it remained unclear who would be on the North Korean side after reports of a purge of Mr. Kim’s team. Asked later if North Korean negotiators were still alive, Mr. Trump said: “I think they are. I can tell you who the main person is. And I would hope the rest are, too.”\r\n\r\nMr. Trump was already scheduled to make an unannounced visit to the DMZ during his trip to South Korea, and he portrayed the idea of meeting Mr. Kim as a spontaneous one, although he had been musing out loud about it for days. Still, it caught even his own staff by surprise and forced an extraordinary scramble to arrange logistics and security, a task that would ordinarily take days or weeks.\r\n</p><p>\r\nMr. Trump gambled that the show of amity could crack the nuclear logjam, underscoring his faith in the power of his own personal diplomacy — even with brutal strongmen like Mr. Kim — to achieve what past presidents could not. More than halfway through his term, Mr. Trump is eager for a resolution to the longstanding dispute, seeing it as a signature element of the legacy he hopes to forge and a potential boost to his re-election campaign.\r\n\r\nEven in this symbolic moment of reconciliation, Mr. Trump seemed to toggle back and forth between glory and grievance, reveling one minute in the history of the day and then the next griping that he was not getting enough credit for reducing friction with North Korea.\r\n\r\nHe seemed acutely defensive about criticism that he has yet to reach an agreement to eliminate North Korea’s nuclear arsenal despite summit meetings with Mr. Kim in Singapore in June 2018 and in Hanoi in February. Almost every time he saw a microphone, he complained that his achievement had not been appreciated.\r\n\r\n“There was great conflict here prior to our meeting in Singapore,” he said. “Tremendous conflict and death all around them. And it’s now been extremely peaceful. It’s been a whole different world.”\r\n\r\nEditors’ Picks\r\n\r\nBuild a Better Savory Pie\r\n\r\nAt 75, Taking Care of Mom, 99: ‘We Did Not Think She Would Live This Long’\r\n</p><p>\r\nHe Was a Famed Novelist of America’s Underclass.

So much has been accomplished.”\r\n\r\nMr. Trump said he and Mr. Kim had agreed to designate negotiators to resume conversations in the next few weeks.\r\nCredit\r\nErin Schaff/The New York Times\r\n\r\n\r\nImage\r\nMr. Trump said he and Mr. Kim had agreed to designate negotiators to resume conversations in the next few weeks.\r\nMr. Trump said he and Mr. Kim had agreed to designate negotiators to resume conversations in the next few weeks.CreditErin Schaff/The New York Times\r\nSince Mr. Trump took office, North Korea has suspended nuclear tests, released detained Americans and sent back to the United States the remains of some American soldiers killed in the war. South Korean officials and others in the region say tension has eased significantly, and Mr. Moon praised Mr. Trump as “the peacemaker of the Korean Peninsula.”\r\n</p><p>\r\nBut American intelligence agencies have concluded that North Korea “is unlikely” to give up its nuclear arsenal, as Mr. Trump has demanded, and even amid the rapprochement with the president, the North has produced enough fuel for a half-dozen additional nuclear weapons, according to one study. In May, it launched short-range missiles in violation of United Nations resolutions.\r\n\r\nCritics called the DMZ greeting an overhyped photo opportunity by a president who himself ratcheted up the conflict with North Korea in his first year in office by vowing to unleash “fire and fury” if it threatened American security.\r\n\r\n“Today is a victory for South Korea’s middle-power diplomacy and President Moon’s peace agenda,” said Leif-Eric Easley, associate professor of international studies at Ewha Womans University in Seoul. “But tomorrow, North Korea will still have nuclear weapons, and the U.S. will still maintain sanctions.”\r\n\r\nMr. Trump’s meeting with Mr. Kim in Singapore was the first time sitting American and North Korean leaders had met anywhere, and it produced vague promises to eliminate Pyongyang’s nuclear arsenal. Their second meeting, in Hanoi, ended in failure when Mr. Kim made an offer that fell far short of that.\r\n</p><p>\r\nNorth Korean officials went dark after the collapse of the talks, refusing to respond to either the Americans or the South Koreans. In recent weeks, however, North Korea re-emerged on the world stage as Mr. Kim exchanged letters with Mr. Trump in what was seen as a signal of its interest in resuming diplomacy.\r\n\r\nAmerican officials have said they did not think a third meeting should be arranged unless a substantive agreement could be negotiated beforehand. But Mr. Trump was seized with the idea of an encounter at the DMZ.\r\n\r\nPanmunjom, which straddles the North-South border, is called the “truce village” because the two sides signed an armistice there in 1953 to halt the three-year Korean War. The two-and-a-half-mile-wide DMZ is a no-man’s zone, but Panmunjom is an exception, a “joint security area” where border guards face off with no buffer between them.\r\n\r\nThe encounter in the truce village of Panmunjom was cast as a brief greeting, not a formal negotiation, but the two leaders ended up together for a little more than an hour.\r\nCredit\r\nErin Schaff/The New York Times\r\n</p><p>\r\n\r\nImage\r\nThe encounter in the truce village of Panmunjom was cast as a brief greeting, not a formal negotiation, but the two leaders ended up together for a little more than an hour.\r\nThe encounter in the truce village of Panmunjom was cast as a brief greeting, not a formal negotiation, but the two leaders ended up together for a little more than an hour.CreditErin Schaff/The New York Times\r\nMr. Kim crossed the DMZ in April 2018 to meet with Mr. Moon, becoming the first North Korean leader to step over the line since the war. Former Presidents Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton each visited North Korea, flying into its capital, Pyongyang, but only after they left office. Sitting presidents, including Ronald Reagan, Mr. Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama, visited the DMZ, but were never greeted by North Korea’s leader.\r\n</p><p>\r\nMr. Trump, wearing a dark suit, emerged from Freedom House on the South Korean side, walked along gravel between two blue huts to the demarcation line and stopped there to wait for Mr. Kim to approach. Mr. Kim, wearing his traditional Mao suit, bounded forward to greet him.\r\n\r\nThey shook hands and Mr. Trump patted the younger man’s arm before they stepped across the barrier and strode across a dirt field. The two turned and shook hands again for the cameras, then walked back to the border marker, posed again, and finally headed toward Freedom House.\r\n\r\nThe scene was fairly chaotic. North Korean security personnel were particularly aggressive, pushing and pulling journalists and even White House staff members, including the new press secretary, Stephanie Grisham. The jostling made television images from the scene look frenzied.\r\n\r\nAccompanying the president were Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, the acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, and other top aides, including Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner. Asked how North Korea was, the president’s daughter answered, “Surreal.”\r\n</p><p>\r\nMr. Kim said he knew nothing about a possible meeting until the president’s tweet. “I don’t think this kind of surprise meeting would have happened without the excellent personal relationship between your excellency and me,” he told Mr. Trump in Freedom House.\r\n\r\nMr. Trump expressed relief that Mr. Kim came. “If he didn’t show up, the press was going to make me look very bad,” he said. So when Mr. Kim arrived, “he made me look very good.”\r\n\r\nAfter their private conversation, which lasted about 50 minutes, Mr. Trump escorted Mr. Kim back to the demarcation line and then watched as the North Korean headed back to his country.\r\n\r\n“Certainly, this was a great day; this was a very legendary, very historic day,” Mr. Trump exulted afterward, before adding a cautionary note. “It’ll be even more historic if something comes out of it.”', 'Peter Baker and Michael Crowley', 2, 0, '2019-06-30 17:38:35', '2019-06-30-173835trump-steps-into-north-korea-and-agrees-with-kim-jong-un-to-resume-talks', 0, 'assets/images/articles/international/20f650c54b6c448a9a8c73a5f3c3221d-superJumbo.jpg', NULL, 1, '2019-08-21 14:26:40'),
